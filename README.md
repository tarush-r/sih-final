Users can report child labour by logging in to this portal using their mobile phone numbers. Users can file complaints by clicking a picture of the offense and recording the location. They will receive an SMS update once the child has been rescued safely by the DPS.
Once the child has been enrolled in a school/STC, their education, vocational training, attendance, meals, costs, enrolled schemes, etc will be tracked through this portal. The portal will also have a functionality that allows management of these records.
The associated authorities will also be able to allocate/track the funds dispersed by the government, approve and verify bills, add expenses, and assign funds to STCs.
 The tracking and monitoring organizations such as VMC, etc will be able to keep watch on DPS, STC, etc through this portal. 
The portal will also have a functionality that enables the  VMC to track children by ID, generate a report and timeline of the child's activity and status. The portal will then send alerts to the concerned parties if anything is found to be out of order.
